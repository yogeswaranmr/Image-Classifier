# Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- A simple image classification project built using TensorFlow and Keras.
- This project trains a CNN to classify images into categories (e.g., cats vs. dogs) using deep learning.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification
- Implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras
- Automatically downloads dataset (cats_vs_dogs from TensorFlow Datasets)
- Includes training, evaluation, and prediction steps

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Source: TensorFlow Datasets - Cats vs Dogs
- Format: Images labeled as either cat or dog
- Dataset is automatically downloaded when you run the notebook

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Achieved ~90% accuracy after training for 10 epochs
- Model can predict whether a given image is a cat or dog

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Predictions

| Image | Predicted |
|-------|-----------|
| cat.jpg | Cat |
| dog.jpg | Dog |
